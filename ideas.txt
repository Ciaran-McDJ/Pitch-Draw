options:
*colour
*size
*speed
*smooth



modes:
*constant x, volume y
*constant x, pithc y
*volume x, pitch y
(or just allow both axis to be controlled by whatever, constant, volume, pitch are options)
*tank controls???



maybe add option for volume or pitch to control other things like paint brush size or colour (or speed... but probably not speed)



Config/option screen
controlPanel - main one - controls size & colour
    configScreen - things that should have restart for activation


spctrograph maybe?




TEMP
for the textbox:
*I need positions of all boxes for clicking to switch to active box
    want to iterate over it and check if position is within range
    if it is in range want to set it to the active box
*I need stuff of active box so I can send it text

Would be better if I made a subclass with the box and text with position so checking position is streamlined, but at this point that feels like too much work, so eh, next time...




Currently crashes if 10..2 is entered where it expects number (2 decimal points). Should fix


In future have config that imports nothing, variables that imports config and nothing else, and a built-in functions module (instead of putting them in 'variables' which was stupid)


Way to make buttons better - make the Button class more generic that just does something on press
    Then  make a subclass (or seperte class) called RadioButton that has a tie to other buttons (like with MutuallyExclusiveButtons) and a value associated with it.  The MutuallyExclusiveButtons class holds the value the buttons modify so when the button is pressed it just modifies the value stored in MutuallyExclusiveButtons
        This reduces redundancy when currently making radio buttons of making a function over and over again to just modify one value to a specific thing


Would be fun to add button to make all UI colours change colour continously through spectrum to be pretty


Should change colour selection so it checks if it's gonna throw an error (instead of stupid giant list) to check if a colour is valid


Could add Opacity of paint brush (alpha value of circle being drawn)


Stuff to add control from UI:
    Audio Chunk size
    Colour selection from rgb values
    Screen Size
