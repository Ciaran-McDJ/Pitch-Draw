options:
*colour
*size
*speed
*smooth



modes:
*constant x, volume y
*constant x, pithc y
*volume x, pitch y
(or just allow both axis to be controlled by whatever, constant, volume, pitch are options)
*tank controls???



maybe add option for volume or pitch to control other things like paint brush size or colour (or speed... but probably not speed)



Config/option screen
controlPanel - main one - controls size & colour
    configScreen - things that should have restart for activation


spctrograph maybe?




TEMP
for the textbox:
*I need positions of all boxes for clicking to switch to active box
    want to iterate over it and check if position is within range
    if it is in range want to set it to the active box
*I need stuff of active box so I can send it text

should I change how it's structured so I can make a button work the same way? Want a way to group some together so only one is active at a time...
